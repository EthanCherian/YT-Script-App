# YT-ScriptSearch

Our project for TAMUhack 2023!

Youtube Scripter is a service created by 4 friends to make your youtube experience better. It helps you find what you're looking for faster and in more ways than youtube ever could be itself. Want to get to a specific moment in a list of videos? Done. Want to filter by topics to make your searches more refined? Done. Scripter does all this to save you save time and effort that you could be using to... watch more youtube! Here's a link to a quick video we made to show the [project.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mHS_RYYYtuD1ZizZ4P8UbAoCYT1f9_hL/view?usp=sharing) Note that this is still a work in progress. This is what we got to during the hackathon.

Thanks for using our website!
